Since version 0.13, a safe railroad crossing like the example shown in the picture can be built. 
This works by restricting access to the tracks when an oncoming train has the rails reserved. 
When the player is on the rails, the signals are reserved by the circuit network, and the train 
must stop and wait until the player leaves the tracks. When a player is inside the area crossing 
the tracks, the train gates are closed so the player can't get on the tracks outside the crossing. 

This is to completely ensure a safe crossing.
